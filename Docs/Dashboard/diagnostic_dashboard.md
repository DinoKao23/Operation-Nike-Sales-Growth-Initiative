# Nike Sales Performance and Customer Engagement Dashboard

## Purpose
The dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance for Nike's range of products. It aims to highlight bestsellers, analyze customer registration impact on sales, and track seasonal sales trends. This insight allows for targeted marketing strategies and inventory management to improve overall sales.

This dashboard is intended for Nike's sales and marketing teams, retail managers, and product strategists who are directly involved in decision-making processes related to product sales, inventory planning, and marketing campaigns.

It offers a data-driven approach to understanding product performance across various categories. By highlighting top sellers and identifying areas with low customer engagement, Nike can tailor its marketing efforts, manage production, and focus on potential growth areas.

The business processes include sales strategy formulation, marketing campaign planning, inventory management, and customer relationship management. Teams can use the dashboard to make informed decisions in these areas.

- Adjusting marketing and advertising spends.
- Focusing on customer registration initiatives.
- Prioritizing inventory restock for high-performing products.
- Developing targeted promotions for products with lower sales.
