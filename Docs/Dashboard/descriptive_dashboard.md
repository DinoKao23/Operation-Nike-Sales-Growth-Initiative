## Nike Descriptive Analytics Dashboard
Note: The Tableau packaged file exceeded the maximum uploading size on GitHub, please review and download the dashboard from the link provided below under Access.

## Purpose
- Audience: scrum master, Nike marketing manager, stakeholders. 
- Our objective is to increase Nike’s sales by improving the marketing performance of our products. The dashboard provides the analysis of revenue by states, product categories, and product subcategories so that we can define the best-selling product categories and subcategories, as well as the profitability of each state. The outcomes would help Nike’s marketing team focus on advertising profitable products in the desired states with different types of strategies and make business decisions on the least profitable product categories, subcategories, and states to resolve the issues. 
- The dashboard will give the management team a detailed overview of our products, customers, and revenue. It will be helpful to see which segment performs better than others, which segment has the most profits, and what kind of products are on our websites.
- The dashboard helps the marketing team see where the profit is coming from and how to increase revenue with the correct strategy. Ex. What kind of products should be included in our promotion? What area should be our target audience when creating a campaign?

## Data Source(s)
- A unified dataset named tran_prod_cust.csv is used for making Nike Descriptive Analytics Dashboard. The tran_prod_cust.csv was made by merging Nike transaction data, Nike product data, and customer data. Tran_prod_cust.csv contains 32 columns and over 1 million records.
- Original dataset from Kaggle: Nike Sportswear Product Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/polartech/nike-sportwear-product-dataset)
- Original dataset from Kaggle: Transaction Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipin20/transaction-data)

## Key Metrics
- Revenue is the cornerstone metric for the Operation Nike Sales Growth Initiative because it directly reflects the effectiveness of Nike's market positioning and strategic initiatives. An increase in revenue not only signifies successful market penetration and consumer satisfaction but also serves as a primary driver for financial stability and growth, enabling further investments in innovation and market expansion.
- Revenue = Number of Units Sold×Price per Unit
- In a more detailed form, especially for a comprehensive analysis, the revenue calculation can include various categories and discounts:
- Total Revenue=(Units Sold of Product A×Price of Product A)+(Units Sold of Product B×Price of Product B)+⋯−Discounts−Returns
